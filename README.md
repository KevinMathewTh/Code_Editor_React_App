# Problem Statement

Frontend (React)

Create an online code editor using React that supports the following features:

There are 3 sections, namely:

1. A “file explorer” pane that contains 3 files: index.html, index.css, index.js.
2. A “code editor” that supports syntax highlighting for HTML, CSS, and JS.
3. A “live view” section to show the rendered HTML website.

Clicking on a file from the “file explorer” should display the corresponding content on the code editor for editing.
The “live view” section must display the rendered website that was created by the user. When a change is made to any of the index.html, index.css, or index.js files, the “live view” section should hot-reload, and display the new output.
